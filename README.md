# Stop Watch
Creating a stopwatch app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves structuring the interface with HTML, styling it with CSS, and implementing functionality using JavaScript. In HTML, you'll set up elements for display and buttons for control. CSS provides the visual design, including layout and appearance. JavaScript handles the stopwatch logic, starting, stopping, and resetting time, and updating the display accordingly. You'll utilize JavaScript's timing functions like setInterval to track time. CSS animations can enhance visual feedback. With these technologies combined, you'll craft a responsive and user-friendly stopwatch app, demonstrating the synergy of web development fundamentals.
